This software will pull economic data from FRED (the Federal Reserve Economic Data online database,
consisting of hundreds of thousands of economic data time series from national, international, public, and private sources created and
maintained by the Research Department at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) and parse the data into Google Sheets. The goal is to
provide accessible, accurate, reproducible, and extensible time-series data at low or zero cost on the widely available Google Apps platform
